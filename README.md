## 
Entomologists & herpetologists: These people collect data on insects (entomologist) and cold-blooded animals (herpetologist). An elementary part of their work is to catch in nature appropriate specimens of the species under study, to determine them, and to make the data of their study available in a nationwide database. On the basis of these data it is possible to see how the population of a species is developing, whether a species is worthy of protection, and whether its occurrence in a region can/must be given special support.
